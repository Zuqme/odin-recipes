            <p><h3>Marinated Grilled Shrimp</h3></p>
               
                <p>A very simple and easy marinade that makes your shrimp so yummy you don't even need cocktail sauce! Don't let the cayenne peper scare you,you don't even taste it. My 2 year old and 4 year-olds love it and eat more shrimp than their parents! It is also a big hit with company,and easy to prepare. i make this with frozen or fresh shrimp and use my indoor electric grill if the weather is not good for outside grilling.try it with a salad,baked potato,and garlic bread. You will not be disappointed!!!
